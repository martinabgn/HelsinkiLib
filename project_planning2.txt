The goal of our project is to create an app that helps the user find relevant information about Helsinki's libraries, especially their facilities and events.
To complete our project, we need to complete the following tasks:

1. Extract the data from the libraries' website (https://helmet.finna.fi) (XL):
1.1 get the list of the libraries (M);
1.2 get the list of the events for the next five months (more or less) (M).

2. Create our search engine (XL):
2.1 implement Boolean search (S);
2.2 implement relevance ranking and multi-word phrases search (M);
2.3 implement NER (M).

3. Create our web UI (XL):
3.1 create a logo (S);
3.2 html coding (M);
3.3 create a Flask interface (M).

We have decided to split our work in a way so each of us has a main focus area:
- Martina: web UI and visualization;
- Siyu: search engine;
- Nafise : data mining.
