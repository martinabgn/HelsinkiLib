**What is the main idea of your application?**

The main idea is to simplify the search of libraries and services across Helsinki (Espoo and Vantaa).

**What problem does it solve?**

There are a lot of chain libraries that operate in the area. Each has multiple locations, their own cards and services available. We wanted to create a place where you can search for a nearby library which has books on the language you are interested in, or provides services you need (as for example 3D printing, sewing machine or room for group work).

**What data would you like to index?**

1. List of library chains and libraries including websites
2. Get the locations
3. Languages available for books
4. Genres of books
5. Other services
6. EXTRA working hours
